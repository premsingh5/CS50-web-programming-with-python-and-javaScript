Project_1:This web application lets user login,logout, search for book based on any of (author,isbn,title) extracted from a data base,
and lets user see the details of the book and give review.

Project_2:In this project, I build an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. Users
will be able to sign into your site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to
communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be
able to send and receive messages with one another in real time

Projects_3:In this project, i built a web application for handling a pizza restaurant’s online orders. Users
will be able to browse the restaurant’s menu, add items to their cart, and submit their orders.
Meanwhile, the restaurant owners will be able to add and update menu items, and view orders that
have been placed.
